      <content type="html" xml:base="/jasper2/TubeStore">&lt;h1 id=&quot;cloud-storage&quot;&gt;Cloud Storage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud storage subscriptions are in high demand due to the exponential growth of data generation. With the advent of digital technology, data production has increased tremendously, leading to a need for more storage capacity. You may have experienced a situation where your Google Drive or other cloud storage shows a warning of reaching its limits. To get more storage, you need to pay more, and this can be quite expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these vast amounts of data, we often have some items that are not accessed frequently, but that we still need for possible future use or as a memory to keep with ourselves. However, you may not have considered YouTube’s storage and its growing number of content creators. YouTube handles a significant amount of data daily, mostly videos from these content creators, and it doesn’t charge any money for that. What if we could use that storage for our data too? Of course, we’re not trying to steal YouTube’s storage, but merely suggesting an idea of how we could make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-tubestore-&quot;&gt;What is TubeStore ?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TubeStore is a tool written in python which can be used to convert any data into a video format, and revert back to the original final without any loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-it-work-&quot;&gt;How does it work ?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, data comes in different formats, but all these formats are stored in 0s and 1s at the end. This is where this tool comes in. It converts all the data to 0s and 1s and creates image frames where each pixel has a value of 0 or 1. This way, if we arrange the binary numbers in the same sequence, we can represent the data in a set of images/frames - thus creating a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method, we can save our data in the form of videos, which is a novel approach to data storage. The process is simple, and it is an excellent way to save data that is not accessed frequently. It is also a great way to keep a memory that we need to keep with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool is useful for taking binary values and shaping them into a different form, but there are two disadvantages that we need to keep in mind. Firstly, the size of the videos generated can be up to 4 times the size of the original file. This means that you need to have a lot of storage space to accommodate the videos that are generated. Secondly, we need a lot of RAM and processing power to convert large files to videos. This can be a significant challenge, especially when dealing with large files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, while testing on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), this tool can convert files up to 200 MB into videos. Beyond that, the RAM gets filled, and the program is killed by the system for safety reasons. However, this is still a significant milestone, and it shows that there is potential for further development of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the idea of using YouTube’s storage for our data is a novel approach to data storage. It is an excellent way to save data that is not accessed frequently, and it is also a great way to keep a memory that we need to keep with ourselves. However, we need to keep in mind the two disadvantages of this tool, namely the large size of the videos generated and the need for a lot of RAM and processing power. Nonetheless, this is still an exciting development, and it is worth exploring further to see how it can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it has been noticed that converting png files causes corruption while reverting back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/jasper2/Seedr</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/jasper2/Seedr">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-&quot;&gt;Introduction :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, torrents have become a popular way to share and distribute large files. However, traditional torrenting methods often require the download of files to a local computer, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Seedr, a revolutionary cloud-based platform, has emerged as a game-changer in the world of torrenting. In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the features, benefits, and functionality of Seedr, exploring how it simplifies the torrenting experience and provides seamless downloading and streaming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/jasper2/Cleansweep">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-exactly-is-cleansweep--&quot;&gt;What exactly is CleanSweep ? :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CleanSweep is a TUI program that helps newbie Arch Linux users to cleanup their system and clear up their precious memory. CleanSweep gives out a step by step process to user to the user with the ability for the user to skip a particular step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-did-i-create-this-tool-&quot;&gt;Why did I create this tool ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arch Linux, as with any operating system, increasing cache memory can potentially improve system performance by allowing the system to store frequently accessed data in fast memory that can be quickly accessed. However, there are also potential drawbacks to increasing cache memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential problem with increasing cache memory is that it can potentially consume a large amount of physical memory, which could lead to increased competition for memory resources and potentially decreased performance if there is not enough available physical memory to meet the system’s needs. Additionally, increasing cache memory may not always provide a noticeable improvement in performance, and in some cases it may even lead to decreased performance due to increased memory pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we go the manual way, we have to run several commands with pacman to clen cache, removed duplicate files etc, but with this one tool, we can go through all the cleaning process step by step with the ability to skip a particular step if not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-i-use-this-&quot;&gt;How do I use this ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ts pretty simple, go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://github.com/AvinashSubhash/CleanSweep&lt;/code&gt; and follow the inctrustions written there.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/jasper2/Data-Privacy-copy">&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-privacy-&quot;&gt;Data Privacy :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns from the last few decades is data privacy. Our data is being sold to many companies right as we read this. One of the main examples that we can observe is the sheer amount of junk mail that we receive. There might be even companies with whom we haven’t even shared any details. There is no way we can completely avoid this situation, but we can shrink our digital footprint. One such method is by demanding these organizations to remove our data, through email. It can be a bit tedious as we have to manually list all these firms and send emails to each one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;saymine&quot;&gt;SayMine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we have this efficient tool named SayMine. It is a web application focused on reducing the digital footprints of individuals, especially removing our data from organizations/services that we no longer use. This application automatically lists out all the organizations that are holding our data. It gives a one-click method to automatically send emails to these companies for our data removal. Thus we can decide which companies can keep our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;junk-reduction&quot;&gt;Junk Reduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of SayMine we can significantly reduce the junk in our mailboxes. You can know more about this application at saymine.com&lt;/p&gt;</content>
