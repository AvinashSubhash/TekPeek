      <content type="html" xml:base="/tekpeek/Rust-in-Linux">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-&quot;&gt;Introduction :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust will be utilized in the next version of the Linux kernel, according to Linux Torvalds, the operating system’s founder. Rust inclusion in Linux kernel development was a topic of discussion for several years before it was eventually settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-exactly-is-rust-&quot;&gt;What exactly is Rust ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is a static compiled language which focuses on performance, memory safety without the use of garbage collectors. Rust has been adapted by several major companies such as Amazon, Discord, Meta, Google and even Microsoft.Rust contains a safe mode where the compiler will check for errors, but it comes with a downside - it is considered a bit restrictive. And for those, who doesn’t like it, they can enable the unsafe mode where this restriction is removed, but then the correctness of the program is to be done by the programmer’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-whats-gonna-happen-when-rust-gets-included-in-linux-&quot;&gt;So what’s gonna happen when Rust gets included in Linux ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is now only being used to write driver code, but it will eventually make an appearance in the kernel as well. Switching to Rust has the previously mentioned benefit of fewer coding memory errors thanks to its “Safe mode.” Additionally, writing driver programs becomes somewhat simpler. There is a long way to go; let’s wait and see what happens. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/tekpeek/Data-Privacy-copy">&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-privacy-&quot;&gt;Data Privacy :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns from the last few decades is data privacy. Our data is being sold to many companies right as we read this. One of the main examples that we can observe is the sheer amount of junk mail that we receive. There might be even companies with whom we haven’t even shared any details. There is no way we can completely avoid this situation, but we can shrink our digital footprint. One such method is by demanding these organizations to remove our data, through email. It can be a bit tedious as we have to manually list all these firms and send emails to each one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;saymine&quot;&gt;SayMine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we have this efficient tool named SayMine. It is a web application focused on reducing the digital footprints of individuals, especially removing our data from organizations/services that we no longer use. This application automatically lists out all the organizations that are holding our data. It gives a one-click method to automatically send emails to these companies for our data removal. Thus we can decide which companies can keep our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;junk-reduction&quot;&gt;Junk Reduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of SayMine we can significantly reduce the junk in our mailboxes. You can know more about this application at saymine.com&lt;/p&gt;</content>
