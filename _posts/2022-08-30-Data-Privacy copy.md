# Data Privacy : 
One of the concerns from the last few decades is data privacy. Our data is being sold to many companies right as we read this. One of the main examples that we can observe is the sheer amount of junk mail that we receive. There might be even companies with whom we havenâ€™t even shared any details. There is no way we can completely avoid this situation, but we can shrink our digital footprint. One such method is by demanding these organizations to remove our data, through email. It can be a bit tedious as we have to manually list all these firms and send emails to each one of them.

# SayMine
And here we have this efficient tool named SayMine. It is a web application focused on reducing the digital footprints of individuals, especially removing our data from organizations/services that we no longer use. This application automatically lists out all the organizations that are holding our data. It gives a one-click method to automatically send emails to these companies for our data removal. Thus we can decide which companies can keep our data.

# Junk Reduction
With the help of SayMine we can significantly reduce the junk in our mailboxes. You can know more about this application at saymine.com
